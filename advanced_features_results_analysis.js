console.log("\n🤔 ANALYSIS OF ULTRA-ENHANCED PERFORMANCE:");
console.log("=" .repeat(50));

console.log("Why Ultra-Enhanced Performed Worse:");
console.log("1. 🐛 Implementation Complexity:");
console.log("   • Multiple layers of optimization may be conflicting");
console.log("   • CAPO and standard optimization might be interfering");
console.log("   • Semantic caching might be caching suboptimal results");

console.log("\n2. 🔧 Over-Engineering:");
console.log("   • Too many optimization strategies applied");
console.log("   • Complex weighting calculations may be reducing effectiveness");
console.log("   • CAPO might be over-optimizing simple prompts");

console.log("\n3. 📊 Resource Allocation:");
console.log("   • CAPO consumes computational budget that could be used for standard optimization");
console.log("   • Complex algorithms might be less efficient than simpler approaches");
console.log("   • Semantic caching might be preventing fresh optimization");

console.log("\n💡 LESSONS LEARNED:");
console.log("=" .repeat(50));
console.log("1. ✅ SIMPLE IS BETTER:");
console.log("   • Enhanced version (8.1%) performed best");
console.log("   • Dynamic weighting + type detection is the sweet spot");
console.log("   • More complexity doesn't always mean better results");

console.log("\n2. 🎯 FOCUS ON WHAT WORKS:");
console.log("   • Type-specific strategies are effective");
console.log("   • Dynamic weighting based on prompt characteristics works");
console.log("   • Keep the optimization pipeline simple and focused");

console.log("\n3. 🚫 AVOID OVER-OPTIMIZATION:");
console.log("   • CAPO might be too aggressive for most use cases");
console.log("   • Semantic caching needs careful implementation");
console.log("   • Too many strategies can reduce overall effectiveness");

console.log("\n🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS:");
console.log("=" .repeat(50));
console.log("1. 🏆 STICK WITH ENHANCED VERSION:");
console.log("   • 8.1% average reduction is good performance");
console.log("   • Simple, reliable, and effective");
console.log("   • Easy to maintain and debug");

console.log("\n2. 🔧 FINE-TUNE ENHANCED VERSION:");
console.log("   • Optimize strategy weights for underperforming types");
console.log("   • Add more type-specific strategies for e-commerce and analytics");
console.log("   • Improve type detection accuracy");

console.log("\n3. 🚀 GRADUAL IMPROVEMENTS:");
console.log("   • Test one advanced feature at a time");
console.log("   • Measure impact of each feature individually");
console.log("   • Only add features that provide measurable improvement");

console.log("\n4. 📊 A/B TESTING APPROACH:");
console.log("   • Test enhanced vs ultra-enhanced on same prompts");
console.log("   • Identify specific cases where advanced features help");
console.log("   • Use advanced features selectively, not universally");

console.log("\n🎉 FINAL RECOMMENDATION:");
console.log("=" .repeat(50));
console.log("✅ USE ENHANCED VERSION (8.1% average) as the base");
console.log("🔧 Fine-tune strategy weights for e-commerce (4.8%) and analytics (5.8%)");
console.log("📈 Target: Reach 10% average with simple improvements");
console.log("🚫 Avoid over-engineering - complexity can hurt performance");

console.log("\n📊 PERFORMANCE HIERARCHY:");
console.log("=" .repeat(50));
console.log("🥇 Enhanced (8.1%): Best overall performance");
console.log("🥈 Original (7.4%): Solid baseline");
console.log("🥉 Ultra-Enhanced (7.0%): Over-engineered");
