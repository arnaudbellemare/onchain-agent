## üè¢ **Integration Path 1: Direct B2B Implementation**

### **For SaaS Companies & High-Volume API Users**

#### **Step 1: Assessment & Setup**
```bash
# Your existing API endpoints provide instant assessment
GET /api/optimization/demo?type=breakdown
# Returns: Current costs vs x402 optimized costs

GET /api/payments/analytics  
# Returns: Real-time cost analysis and optimization opportunities
```

#### **Step 2: Integration Process**
```typescript
// 1. Replace traditional API calls with x402
const x402Client = new X402APIClient(agentKit, walletAddress);

// 2. Enable autonomous optimization
const autonomousEngine = new AutonomousOperationsEngine();
autonomousEngine.start(); // Runs 24/7 cost optimization

// 3. Track savings in real-time
const savings = await x402Client.getOptimizationReport();
```

#### **Step 3: Business Model**
- **Setup Fee:** $10,000-25,000 (one-time implementation)
- **Ongoing Fee:** 25% of client savings (typically $5,000-15,000/month)
- **ROI for Client:** 75% of savings (typically $15,000-45,000/month)

  providers: ["openai", "anthropic", "coingecko"]
});

// Agent makes API calls with automatic x402 payments
const result = await aiAgent.makeAPICall("openai", "gpt-4", {
  prompt: "Analyze this data...",
  maxCost: 0.10 // Max $0.10 for this call
});
```

#### **Business Model:**
