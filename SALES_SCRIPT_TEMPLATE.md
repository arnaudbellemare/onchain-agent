# ðŸ’¼ Sales Script Template: x402 + AgentKit

## **Cold Outreach Email Template**

### **Subject: Save 90% on API Costs - Live Demo Available**

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is likely spending significant amounts on API services. I wanted to share something that could save you 90% on those costs.

We've built a revolutionary system using x402 protocol + AgentKit that enables:
- Granular per-call cost tracking
- Real-time micropayments (no subscriptions)
- 24/7 autonomous optimization
- Direct USDC payments (no processing fees)

**Real Results:** One client reduced their API costs from $4,000/month to $2,100/month - that's $22,800 in annual savings.

I'd love to show you a 15-minute demo of how this works. Would you be available for a quick call this week?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's our interactive ROI calculator: [Link to your ROI calculator]

## **Discovery Call Script (15 minutes)**

### **Opening (2 minutes)**
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time to speak with me. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief.

I'm reaching out because we've developed something that's saving companies 90% on their API costs, and I thought it might be relevant for [Company].

Before I dive in, can you tell me a bit about your current API usage? Roughly how much are you spending monthly on API services?"

### **Problem Discovery (5 minutes)**
**Key Questions:**
1. "What's your biggest pain point with current API costs?"
2. "How much are you spending monthly on API services?"
3. "What percentage of that is subscription vs. usage-based?"
4. "How much time does your team spend managing API costs?"
5. "Have you looked into cost optimization solutions before?"

**Listen for:**
- High monthly API spend ($5K+)
- Subscription overhead complaints
- Manual cost management pain
- Previous failed optimization attempts

### **Solution Presentation (5 minutes)**
"Based on what you've told me, I think we can help. Let me show you exactly how this works."

**Demo Script:**
1. **Show ROI Calculator:** "Let's plug in your numbers..."
2. **Live Demo:** "Here's how the x402 protocol works..."
3. **Real Results:** "This client went from $4,000 to $2,100 monthly..."

**Key Points:**
- "No more subscription overhead"
- "Pay only for what you use"
- "24/7 autonomous optimization"
- "Direct USDC payments eliminate processing fees"

### **Objection Handling (2 minutes)**
**Common Objections:**

**"This sounds too good to be true"**
- "I understand the skepticism. That's why we offer a 30-day pilot with guaranteed savings. If we don't save you at least 30%, you pay nothing."

**"We're happy with our current setup"**
- "That's great! What if I could show you how to get the same results for 50% less? Would that be worth a 15-minute conversation?"

**"We don't have budget for this"**
- "That's exactly why this makes sense. We only get paid from your savings. If we save you $10K/month, we take $2.5K and you keep $7.5K."

**"We need to think about it"**
- "Of course. What specific concerns do you have that I can address?"

### **Close (1 minute)**
"Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like this could save [Company] around $[X] per month. 

Would you be interested in a 30-day pilot where we implement this for one of your API services? We guarantee at least 30% savings, or you pay nothing.

What would be the best way to move forward?"

## **Demo Script (30 minutes)**

### **Setup (5 minutes)**
"Thanks for joining me today. I'm going to show you exactly how we can save you 90% on API costs.

First, let me understand your current situation better. Can you tell me:
1. Which APIs are you using most heavily?
2. Roughly how much are you spending monthly?
3. What's your biggest pain point with current costs?"

### **ROI Calculator Demo (10 minutes)**
"Let's start by calculating your potential savings. I'll use our interactive ROI calculator."

**Steps:**
1. **Input their numbers:** Monthly API calls, current cost per call
2. **Show traditional costs:** Subscription + overage fees
3. **Show x402 costs:** Micropayments with 30% discount
4. **Calculate savings:** Monthly and annual savings
5. **Show your fee:** 25% of their savings

**Example:**
"If you're making 100,000 API calls per month at $0.03 per call, that's $3,000 in usage costs. But with subscriptions and overages, you're probably paying $4,000 total.

With x402 protocol, you'd pay $2,100 for the same usage. That's $1,900 in monthly savings, or $22,800 annually. Our fee would be $5,700, leaving you with $17,100 in net savings."

### **Live Demo (10 minutes)**
"Now let me show you how this actually works in practice."

**Demo Flow:**
1. **Show current API call:** Traditional method with subscription
2. **Show x402 API call:** Micropayment in real-time
3. **Show cost comparison:** Side-by-side cost breakdown
4. **Show autonomous optimization:** AgentKit working 24/7
5. **Show dashboard:** Real-time cost tracking and optimization

**Key Points:**
- "No account creation required"
- "Pay only for what you use"
- "Real-time price discovery"
- "Autonomous optimization without human intervention"

### **Use Cases (5 minutes)**
"Let me show you how this applies to different scenarios:"

1. **AI Agents:** "Your chatbots can pay for API calls in real-time"
2. **Cloud Storage:** "Access storage without account creation"
3. **Content Creators:** "True micropayments for content consumption"

## **Pilot Program Script**

### **Pilot Proposal**
"Based on our conversation, I'd like to propose a 30-day pilot program:

**What we'll do:**
- Implement x402 protocol for one of your API services
- Set up AgentKit autonomous optimization
- Provide real-time cost tracking and reporting
- Guarantee at least 30% cost reduction

**What you'll get:**
- Detailed cost analysis and optimization report
- Live dashboard showing real-time savings
- Implementation guide for scaling to other APIs
- 30-day money-back guarantee

**Investment:**
- Setup fee: $5,000 (waived if you don't see 30% savings)
- Ongoing fee: 25% of your monthly savings
- No long-term commitment required

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Implementation and setup
- Week 2-4: Monitoring and optimization
- Week 4: Results review and scaling plan

Does this sound like something you'd be interested in?"

## **Closing Scripts**

### **Assumptive Close**
"Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like this could save [Company] around $[X] per month. 

I'd like to get started with the pilot program. When would be a good time to begin implementation?"

### **Alternative Choice Close**
"Would you prefer to start with a 30-day pilot, or would you like to see a more detailed implementation plan first?"

### **Urgency Close**
"We're currently working with 5 other companies in your industry. I'd hate for you to miss out on these savings while your competitors get ahead.

Would you like to secure your spot in our pilot program?"

### **Risk Reversal Close**
"I'm so confident this will work that I'm willing to guarantee your savings. If we don't save you at least 30% in the first month, you pay nothing.

What do you have to lose?"
